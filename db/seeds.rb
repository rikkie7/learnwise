I'm the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to teach their employees. My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game. Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my greatest passion is teaching. I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.

  One of the best parts of the course was the instructor, Stephen. He really knows Rust inside and out and had a knack for explaining tricky concepts in a simple and relatable way, making the whole learning process enjoyable and effective.
  The only thing Iâ€™d love to see is for Stephen to add one more chapter at the end to tie everything together with a useful project. That would be the perfect finishing touch!",
